# Matrix_Desktop
My matrix-y desktop that I made for myself (Windows only)

To build:

```make```

This outputs an executable named `matrix_desktop.exe`. Once started, it will run as a background process and animate the desktop. When the user is not focused on a fullscreen application, it updates the background every 750ms with the classic matrix pattern.
